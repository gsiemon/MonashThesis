# Unofficial UQ Thesis Template for R Markdown
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is an unofficial R Markdown port of The University of Queensland Graduate 
# School Official LaTeX Thesis template to R Markdown. This template uses 
# material from a Monash University template written by Rob Hyndman.
# See https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashThesis for details.
#
# The actual thesis content is in several Rmd files that are compiled into a 
# single document using the r packages: knitr, bookdown and tinytex.
#
# Edit the _bookdown.yml file to set the order in which you'd like the Rmd files  
# to appear. Changing the order of the files starting in 00- is not recommended.
#
# If you have specific LaTeX packages to add, put them in the LaTexPackages.tex 
# file.
#
# You will need to ensure you have installed the bookdown package for R and
# have  LaTeX installed on your computer. Refer to the Readme.md file for
# details.
